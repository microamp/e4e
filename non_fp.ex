  This function has a character list consisting of T and F for its first argument. A T in the list indicates that the tooth is present, and a F indicates a missing tooth. This will be a single quoted character list, so you can treat it just as you would any other list. Remember to refer to individual characters as ?T and ?F.

  The second argument is a floating point number between 0 and 1.0 that indicates the probability that a tooth will be a good tooth.

  The result is a list of lists, one list per tooth. If a tooth is present, the sublist has six entries; if a tooth is absent, the sublist is [0].

  end

  @doc """
  The first two arguments are the same as for generate_pockets/2; the third argument is the accumulated list. When the first argument is an empty list, the function yields the reverse of the accumulated list.

  Hint: use pattern matching to figure out whether a tooth is present or not. For a non-present tooth, add [0] to the accumulated list; for a tooth that is present, create a list of six numbers by calling generate_tooth/1 with the probability of a good tooth as its argument.
